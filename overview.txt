Abstract:
This assignment was a refresher of some previously learned concepts and practices. The assignment
looks little subtle on its shell, but as someone deep dives it exposes challenges at different level.
For example: 
1.The assignment is silent about certain use cases and behavior of the model classes. That 
pushes us to think about all different corners and permutations that can be drawn upon the system built 
with couple of classes.    
2. The assignment is silent around certain collaboration scenarios e.g. how coordinate class wraps the 
coordinate value based on the frame of reference or the world in which it exists. In other words how the 
world exposes its dimension to the coordinate class, such questions are the intrigue part of the assignment.
3. Writing the test first is always challenging and I've definitely enjoyed TDD exercise.
4. Writing correct implementation for equals and hash code is always challenging as we need to ensure 
equivalence relation for equality.
5. There are certain scenarios where I wanted to use Mockito type of unit test framework to write introspection 
tests and to verify call back. However, I've override World and Coordinate classes in some test scenarioes
to mimic the mock behavior.
